Afa-games
Project Description
Afa-games is my first web project, created to show my skills in making browser games. The project has three classic games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Minesweeper, and Battleship. 
Each game has different difficulty levels and is available in three languages.

Key Features
Difficulty Levels: each game has multiple levels, so users can choose the level they like.
Localization: the interface is available in three languages, and users can switch languages without reloading the page.
Mobile-Friendly: the project is fully adapted for mobile devices.

Technologies
This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game logic is written in plain JavaScript, including the interface and functions for languages and difficulty levels.

How to Start
Just open [Afa-games on GitHub Pages](https://darogible.github.io/Afa-games/) to start playing.
